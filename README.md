Prototypes / Samples

Can you provide prototypes or sample units for evaluation? Please advise lead time, cost (if any), and the process to request samples.
Annual Requirement

We estimate a need for approximately 4,000 iron‑phosphate (LFP) square/prismatic batteries per year in these configurations:
3.2 V / 150 Ah
3.2 V / 200 Ah
3.2 V / 300 Ah
Pricing (please quote average price per kWh)

LFP square/prismatic (3.2 V / 150 Ah, 200 Ah, 300 Ah)
18650 (3.7 V / 2600 mAh)
Please state currency (USD preferred), whether price is for cells only or for modules/packs, and any volume discounts for the annual quantities above.
Sodium‑Ion Batteries

I understand CATL produces sodium‑ion batteries. Please provide details on available sodium‑ion products, typical specifications (nominal voltage, capacities, energy density, cycle life), lead times, and pricing.
Additional details requested

Minimum order quantities (MOQs), typical lead times, shipping/incoterms options, available supply locations/warehouses (please list countries/regions), pricing at each location, warranty terms, certifications (e.g., IEC/UL), and BMS compatibility.
Technical datasheets for the listed products.
We would be grateful for a formal quotation and any technical datasheets you can share. If useful, I can provide more detailed application requirements or sign an NDA.

P.S. — Please include information on supply places and the prices applicable at each location.

Best regards,
